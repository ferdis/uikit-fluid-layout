UIKit Fluid layout
==
This example, Fluid layout, is modelled upon Bootstrap's which can be found here: http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/examples/fluid.html

This round goes to UIKit, hands down. Although there were some inconsistancies between Boostrap and UIkit, mainly due to the fact that things are normally done "differently" in UIKit, not a lot of custom styles were applied(only two).

Responsiveness was also added to this example, something Bootstrap did not care to include into their own.
The off-canvas navigation was again used for mobile navigation.

Why
---
The idea behind this(and other uikit-*) repositories is to act as a comparison between UIKit and Bootstrap with regards to looks and design, functionality and markup.
Additionallity, it also serves as a quick baseline comparison of how both frameworks appear visually.
